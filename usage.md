## üìÇ Data Operations

### 1. Importing Data

To import initial data, you must place the CSV files in the `test-data/` folder. The application will prompt you to import from these files.

**Example command flow**:
* Choose option `4. Import/Export Data`.
* Select `Import Students from CSV` or `Import Courses from CSV`.
* The application will read data from `test-data/students.csv` or `test-data/courses.csv`.

### 2. Exporting Data

You can export current application data to a `data/` folder in the project root. This creates CSV-like files for students, courses, and enrollments.

**Example command flow**:
* Choose option `4. Import/Export Data`.
* Select `Export All Data`.
* The exported files will be saved in a new folder, e.g., `data/students.csv`, `data/courses.csv`, etc.

### 3. Backing Up Data

The backup command copies all exported data to a timestamped folder inside a `backup/` directory. It also recursively calculates the total size of the backup folder.

**Example command flow**:
* First, export data (see above).
* Choose option `5. Backup Data & Show Backup Size`.
* A new folder like `backup/2025-09-25_14-30-00/` will be created, containing the exported files.
* The total size of the folder will be printed to the console.

## üìù Test Data

The `test-data/` folder should be located in the root directory of your project, alongside `src/` and other project files. It should contain simple, plain-text CSV files for importing.

### `students.csv`

This file contains sample student data. The format is `regNo,fullName,email,status`.
